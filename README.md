# Traveling-salesman-problem
Genetic algorithm approach was implemented to solve traveling salesman problem. This project was a part of Research&amp;Innovation course completion

Python 3.6.1

Several different population sizes were selected (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128) and optimization calculation were performed to obtain the order of cities that minimizes the total distance.
